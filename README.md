#Language words

This project targets a specific yet vital part of the language learning process. **Contextualizing vocabulary acquisition.**

There are two parts in this process that are deemed equally important in the design of the program:
1. Formulating context that corresponds to the language learning experience
2. Returning to the contextualized vocabulary and revisiting/updating by incorporating new knowledge/experience

The means to achieve this is by adding tags to words. Tags should not be viewed as a recalling mechanism or an alternative way to organize content (one example could be a folder hierarchy), but as the way to capture the context into which we have made contact with the word. So for example 

In this sense tagging should be used **unparcimoniously** 

#Possible concrete examples
1. Reading a book in a foreign language
2. Introducing oneself to the terminology of a domain (scientific or other)

#What stays out of the project's current scope
1. ex-nihilo language learning
  The user should have a good level of reading comprehension, or else context will be very hard to construct and finally to be project to the data structure.
