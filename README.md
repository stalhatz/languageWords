# Language words

This project targets a specific yet vital part of the language learning process. **Contextualizing vocabulary acquisition.**

There are three parts in this process that have been deemed equally important in the design of the program:
1. Formulating context that corresponds to the language learning experience
2. Returning to the contextualized vocabulary and revisiting/updating by incorporating new knowledge/experience
3. Extending vocabulary by an acquisition method based on the context already provided by the user

  The means used to achieve these goals are:

  A. Attaching tags to words. Tags should not be viewed as a recalling mechanism or an alternative way to organize content (one example could be a folder hierarchy), but as the way to capture the context into which the learner has made contact with the word. So for example if a user makes contact with the word /shoot/ it has a very different notion when seen in a sports context, a firearms context or a drug usage context. The tag attached to the word should be dependent on context category as well as the word usage inside this context.
  B. Co-categorization of words. 
  C. Storing specialized definitions from a dictionary resource 
  D. Manually adding the passage where the word was seen. 
  
  should also be used to further enhance the placement of the word within the language ontology that the user is constructing.

Note here that there is no real shortcut to this procedure. In other words, there is no point in sharing a document created with this program between users or inferring in an automatic way tags or appropriate definitions : This IS the learning procedure. The documents produced should be unique to each user, reflecting their prior experience/competences and language construction, as well as their learning experience. In addition to this, the context documents should be always available to be revisited and of a certain value both to the user as well as the community he is trying to learn the language of. To give an example, in the foreign language learning community using a piece of literature that has been read by most of the foreign language community (like *Don Quichote* when learning Spanish or *A brief history of time* when introducing oneself to cosmology) can help the user create shared context with the community which in essence corresponds to "learning" the language.

When considering using this method for foreign language learning you have to keep in mind that this is an unnatural mechanism for learning a language. Language learning requires social demand for recognition of phonemes and written words as well as depending on their meaning action. In this sense, this method could be used in an auxilliary manner to a more classical approach (classroom, language travel, student exchange). In any other case the objectives set from such a method should be very limited going as far as text comprehension at best.

In this sense tagging should be used **unparcimoniously** 

#Possible concrete examples
1. Reading a book in a foreign language
2. Introducing oneself to the terminology of a domain (scientific or other)

#What stays out of the project's current scope
1. ex-nihilo language learning
  The user should have a good level of reading comprehension, or else context will be very hard to construct and finally to be project to the data structure.
